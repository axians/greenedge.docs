# Baseline

A baseline is the start year of the business unit collected emissions (CO2e) for an entire year. Based on the baseline can budgets be created and thereafter actions to reach each goal. Baseline year can 
differ depending on the organization. For example Vinci Energies, its yearly carbon emission budgets are based on 2019 emissions and the commitment of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by the end of 2030. 
The yearly budget are expected to be decreasing by an average of 4.55% per year.

# Budget

When baseline has been set, a budget will be created for each year up until next year. Thereafter a new budget will have to be created every year and followed up by actions. Each yearly budget is a total carbon 
emission goal for that specific year, to be able to reach the longterm goal.
