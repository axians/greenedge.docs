To be able to reach our goals from the budget that has been sett based on the baseline, we need actions. Actions can be anything from changing our way of working, switching to LEDs or transportation. These actions
require a member to follow them up and an esitmate of carbon emission impact. Togheter will the actions be calculated from the business units budget. To demonstrate how big of an impact the actions will have. But
also how much more carbon dioxide that will be left. More actions might need to be created in that case to reach our goal.

# AI generator

When clicking on "Suggested actions" under the "Budget and Actions" section. An AI will help to suggest a couple of actions that might be helpful for the business unit. The AI will calculate the actions based
on the information that exists about the business unit, such as business unit general information, emission sources, sites etc. These actions will already be prefilled with the suggestion but only require a
member to be responsible for following it up. Just like any other action these can also be modified or deleted.
