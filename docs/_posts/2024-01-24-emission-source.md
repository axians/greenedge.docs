**Emission sources** refers to the origins of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to climate change.

> CO2-e stands for "Carbon Dioxide Equivalent". It is a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints. The idea is to express the impact of each different greenhouse gas in terms of the amount of CO2 that would create the same amount of warming.

## Collection of emissions
> It is important to understand that emissions are collected in its original *Unit* and *Scale*. For instance, *Diesel* as an Emission source, might be collected as “Km” and needs to be converted into “CO2-e”. More on this in the “Emission factor” section further down.   

Emissions can be received by GreeEdge through one of the following:

### On-site integration
This option automates the process of collecting emission data through connected meters and sensors. This is typical for electricity (kWh), heat (kWh) and water (m3)

### API integration
*API integration* refers to emissions collected from third party vendor such as a travel agency or waste management company. Like *On-site integration*, API integration automates the process of collecting emission data. 

### File import
*File import* is applicable where API integration is not possible. However, through the use of templates, the file import process is fairly simple.


## Categorizing
These emissions can be categorized into three scopes:

### Scopes
**Scope 1:** Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the entity, such as a headquarters facility1.

**Scope 2:** Indirect emissions resulting from the entity’s activities but occur at sources that the entity neither owns nor controls, such as a utility or an airline1.

**Scope 3:** Emissions that occur as a result of the entity’s operations but are produced from sources neither owned nor controlled by the entity. Examples include emissions generated by suppliers, employee commute and business travel, and landfill waste disposal1.

### Categories
Subsequently, Emission sources can also be categorized in a more common fashion such as: Travel-, Transport- and Site emission. Each category also has one or more sub-categories.

## Share Emission
As a general rule of thumb, an Emission source should only be crated once but used by many Business units. As such creating new Emission sources require special privileges. When creating a new Emission source, the administrator can set the on which level the it can be shared, thereby preventing Business unit of using Emission sources intended for other regions.

## Emission factor
Every Emission source need to have a **Factor** which is used transform the collected value to CO2-e. For instance, HVO100 (Green diesel) has a factor of 0.39/Km, while normal diesel has 2.60/Km. This means that if you drive 100 Km using regular diesel you will consume 260 CO2-e kg while only 39 CO2-e kg using HVO100. 

Every Emission source need to have a **Factor** which is used transform the collected value to CO2-e. For instance, HVO100 (Green diesel) has a factor of 0.39/Km, while normal diesel has 2.60/Km. This means that if you drive 100 Km using regular diesel you will consume 260 CO2-e kg while only 39 CO2-e kg using HVO100. 
**GreenEdge** will automatically convert the original values to CO2-e which in turn makes it possible to group, summarize and report your total carbon emission footprint.
