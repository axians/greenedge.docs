*As with financial goals, the single most important aspect is to bring everyone onboard and working towards the same goal. The purpose of the **GreenEdge** dashboard is just that, -to visualize your progress and path towards the target.*

The **GreeEdge** dashboard is intended to be used for internal communication among staff members as well as providing insight to external customers and vendors. It can be shown on a screen in  a reception. A PowerPoint slide or shared with a customer to provide information about how you are addressing your carbon emission footprint. The dashboards is made up of *widgets*, which can be customized and look different for your organization:

To begin with, GreenEdge comes with **two** dashboards. -One for Business units and one for Organizations. While the Organizational dashboard provides an aggregated overview of all underlying Business units, the Business unit dashboard provides a detailed view.

## Navigation
On the top of the dashboard you find the navigation, which lets you navigate from the top of your organization all the way to individual Business units. The hieratical structure represents your entire organization.

## Dashboard content 
> Important, the dashboards and widges provided throughout this module may differ from the one in your organization. This is because dashboards and widgets can be customized.

Here is a few examples of what widgets can look like:

### Accumulated yearly emissions

*This widget shows an accumulated graph where each bar shows emissions by category (travel, transport and site), together with the budget.*

### Historic emissions

*Historic emissions gives an overview since the **baseline year**, and like the Accumulated emissions graph, also shows the budget as a line across the bars*

### The "Barometer"

The barometer widget is intended to show the current state of an Organization or Business unit. On the left you can find the emissions from the baseline year while on the right youâ€™ll find the target. In between these you can see the current year.

### Actions

*Actions represents activities Organizations plan to do to reach their respective budget. While these are aggregated by category in the Organizational dashboard, they will show in more details on the Business unit dashboard*
