*GreenEdge automates data collection and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions for enterprises. It minimizes the effort and enhances the data quality for reporting and budgets along with a customized dashboard to further engage staff members, partners and customers.*

**GreenEdge** is made to give controll of your carbon emission footprint by automating the process of collecting the emissions.

Througout this course we will go through all aspects of GreeEdge, such as *Sites*, *Emissions*, *Reporting*, *Budgets* and more.

## Basic definitions

### Organizations
Organizations reflects the hierarchical structure of your organization, and may be made up of multiple levels which often reflects geographical regions to some level.

Organizations are visible through the navigation of the GreenEdge dashboard. *Organizational* dashboards provides an **aggregated** overview of all *Business units* below.

> *Organizations* cannot be managed through GreenEdge. Changes in the organizational structure is handled through integration with back-end systems.

### Business units
Business units is where it happens! All *Emissions*, *Reporting* and *Budgets* are collected and managed on *Business unit* level. All *Business units* belong to one *Organization*.

### Sites
A site represents any type of facility, such as an office, a warehouse or a store. A *Business unit* may have one or more *sites*, and may share *sites* with other *Business units*.

*Sites* may optionally be connected where *emissions* such as electricity, heating and water is automatically collected.

### Emission sources
*Emission sources* are collected in a "raw" format, where unit and scale may differ. For instance, electricity is collected in **kWh** while diesel might be collected in **liters**. All Emission sources are catagorized and given a **factor**. This factor is used to convert the raw input to CO2-e.

There are three ways of *Emissions* can be collected:
* **Integrated sites**
    * *Emissions are automatically collected from meters and sensors installed on-site*
* **API integration**
    * *Emissions are automatically collected from calling external vendors or partners*
* **File import**
    * *Emissions are created through file-import*

### Reporting
GreenEdge comes with a reporting tool that can be used to analyse your carbon emission footprint. While there are many built-in reports, you can also create your own reports.

### Budgets
Your organization has an overall goal of how to lower the carbon emission footprint. This goal is defined by a "baseline" year, an "target" year together with a percentage of how much it should be lowered.

Each *Business unit* is given individual budgets aligned with the overall goal. To meet the budget, *Business units* needs to define a number of *Actions*. For instance, an *Action* might be "Switch all lamps to led", or "Only use HVO100 for service vehicles"
