*Sites* refers to any type of building associated by the Business unit such as an office, a warehouse, a store or a parking facility. 
Sites can be shared with other Business units or legal entities outside the scope of your organization. For instance, an office space might be part of a bigger complex shared with many other companies. In such cases it’s common that the usage of electricity and heating is split among the tenants based on the square space used.

In such cases it’s important to be able to set the percentage of shared emissions, after which **GreenEdge** will distribute the CO2-e among the Business units.

While Sites can be shared among one or more Business units, only one can be *Owner*. The *Owner* is the only one that can change the Site, such as adding or removing other Business units.

Site emissions can be collected automatically through connected meters on-site.
